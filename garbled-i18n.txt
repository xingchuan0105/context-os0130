advanced.rebuild.help.whenTitle	When should I rebuild embeddings?
advanced.rebuild.help.whenIntro	You should rebuild embeddings when:
advanced.rebuild.help.when.switchModelTitle	Switching embedding models:
advanced.rebuild.help.when.switchModelDesc	If you change from one embedding model to another, you need to rebuild all embeddings to ensure consistency.
advanced.rebuild.help.when.upgradeTitle	Upgrading model versions:
advanced.rebuild.help.when.upgradeDesc	When updating to a newer version of your embedding model, rebuild to take advantage of improvements.
advanced.rebuild.help.when.fixCorruptTitle	Fixing corrupted embeddings:
advanced.rebuild.help.when.fixCorruptDesc	If you suspect some embeddings are corrupted or missing, rebuilding can restore them.
advanced.rebuild.help.when.bulkImportTitle	After bulk imports:
advanced.rebuild.help.when.bulkImportDesc	If you imported content without embeddings, use ?All? mode to embed everything.
advanced.rebuild.help.timeTitle	How long does rebuilding take?
advanced.rebuild.help.timeIntro	Processing time depends on:
advanced.rebuild.help.timeFactor1	Number of items to process
advanced.rebuild.help.timeFactor2	Embedding model speed
advanced.rebuild.help.timeFactor3	API rate limits (for cloud providers)
advanced.rebuild.help.timeFactor4	System resources
advanced.rebuild.help.timeTypical	Typical rates:
advanced.rebuild.help.timeLocal	Local models (Ollama): Very fast, limited only by hardware
advanced.rebuild.help.timeCloud	Cloud APIs (OpenAI, Google): Moderate speed, may hit rate limits with large datasets
advanced.rebuild.help.timeSources	Sources: Slower than notes/insights (creates multiple chunks per source)
advanced.rebuild.help.timeExample	Example: Rebuilding 200 items might take 2?5 minutes with cloud APIs, or under 1 minute with local models.
advanced.rebuild.help.safeTitle	Is it safe to rebuild while using the app?
advanced.rebuild.help.safeIntro	Yes, rebuilding is safe!
advanced.rebuild.help.safeItem1	Is idempotent: Running multiple times produces the same result
advanced.rebuild.help.safeItem2	"Doesn't delete content: Only replaces embeddings"
advanced.rebuild.help.safeItem3	Can be run anytime: No need to stop other operations
advanced.rebuild.help.safeItem4	Handles errors gracefully: Failed items are logged and skipped
advanced.rebuild.help.safeCaution	Note: Very large rebuilds (1000s of items) may temporarily slow down searches while processing.

settings.embedding.help.ask	? Choose ?ask? if you want to decide each time
settings.embedding.help.never	? Choose ?never? if you do not need vector search or lack an embedding provider
settings.embedding.help.reference	Reference: OpenAI?s text-embedding-3-small costs about $0.02 per 1M tokens ? roughly 30? the Wikipedia page for Earth. Gemini Text Embedding 004 is free with a 1500 RPM rate limit.

settings.files.help.yes	? Choose ?yes? (recommended) to delete uploaded files after processing
settings.files.help.no	? Choose ?no? only if you need to keep originals in the upload folder
